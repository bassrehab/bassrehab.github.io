Hey everyone,

I've got some exciting (and slightly scary) news to share: I'm leaving my current employer! After 4 amazing years, I've decided to take the leap and start my own company, truckaurbus.com.

Why am I doing this? Well, I've always been fascinated by the commercial vehicle industry. It's a massive market with so much potential for innovation. And with my experience in tech, I think I can bring something new to the table.

Truckaurbus.com is going to be an online platform where you can buy and sell commercial vehicles, get the latest industry news, and connect with other people in the business. Think of it like a one-stop shop for everything truck and bus related.

I know this is a big risk, but I'm incredibly excited about the possibilities. I've learned so much at Microsoft, and I'm grateful for all the opportunities I've had there. But it's time for me to try something new and follow my passion.

I'll be sharing more updates about truckaurbus.com as we get closer to launch. In the meantime, I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback. Feel free to leave a comment below or shoot me an email at subhadipm@truckaurbus.com

Thanks for all your support!
