ELT-C injects that vibrancy - the demographics, traffic patterns, and even the local buzz. With the added dimensions of Context Stores, your data city becomes a place of strategic insights and informed action.</p> <blockquote> <p>As we develop an increasing number of generative AI applications powered by large language models (LLMs), contextual information about the organization’s in-house datasets becomes crucial. This contextual data equips our platforms to effectively and successfully deploy GenAI applications in real-world scenarios, ensuring they are relevant to specific business needs and tailored to the appropriate contexts.</p> </blockquote> <p>Let’s explore how this integrated approach empowers data-driven decision-making.</p> <p><br></p> <h1 id="introducing-elt-c">Introducing ELT-C</h1> <p>Let’s recap the key ETL stages followed by the Contextualize:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Extract</strong> The “Extract” stage involves pulling data from its original sources. These could be databases, applications, flat files, cloud systems, or even IoT devices! The goal is to gather raw data in its various forms.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Load</strong> Once extracted, data is moved (“Loaded”) into a target system designed to handle large volumes. This is often a data warehouse, data lake, or a cloud-based storage solution. Here, the focus is on efficient transfer and storage, minimizing changes to the raw data.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Transform</strong> This stage is all about making data usable for analysis. Transformations could include:</p> <ul> <li>Cleaning and standardizing data (e.g., fixing inconsistencies, handling missing values)</li> <li>Merging datasets from different sources</li> <li>Calculations or aggregations (like calculating totals or averages)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Contextualize</strong> Contextualization is the heart of ELT-C, going beyond basic data processing and turning your information into a powerful analysis tool. It involves adding layers of information, including:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Metadata</strong>: Descriptive details about the data itself, such as where it originated, when it was collected, what data types are included, and any relevant quality indicators. This makes data easier to understand, catalog, and use.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>External Data</strong>: Enriching your data by linking it to external sources. This might include:</p> <ul> <li>Customer demographics: Supplementing sales transactions with customer age, location, or income data for better segmentation.</li> <li>Market trends: Adding industry reports or competitor data to contextualize your company’s performance.</li> <li>Weather data: Correlating weather patterns with sales trends or energy consumption patterns to understand external drivers.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>User Data</strong>: Augmenting data with insights about how users interact with your products, services, or website. This could include:</p> <ul> <li>Website behavior: Tracking user navigation paths to reveal buying intent or improve site design.</li> <li>App engagement: Analyzing in-app behavior to identify churn indicators or opportunities to boost retention.</li> <li>LLM engagement: Flowback LLM analytics data as in-house technical / business users and end-customers of your platform interact with other LLM applications. This could include insights on the types of queries, responses, and feedback generated within the LLM ecosystem.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p><br></p> <h2 id="example-elt-c-for-next-best-offers---turning-data-into-personalized-credit-card-solutions">Example: ELT-C for Next Best Offers - Turning Data into Personalized Credit Card Solutions</h2> <p>Let’s see how the combination of metadata, external data, and user data could all be leveraged by a retail bank to optimize next-best credit card offers, with a focus on how contextualization enhances traditional approaches:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Metadata</strong></p> <ul> <li> <strong>Example:</strong> Detailed metadata on customer transactions, product descriptions, and marketing campaign data. This includes timestamps, source systems, data types, and quality scores, etc.</li> <li> <strong>How it helps:</strong> Ensures the bank uses up-to-date, reliable information and can trace any issues back to the origin.</li> <li> <strong>Contextualize for Better Analysis</strong>: Knowing the recency of data is key for some offers (e.g., targeting recent high spenders). Metadata on the origin of data could reveal if certain marketing campaigns outperform others based on the data source, leading to refined targeting strategies.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>External Data</strong></p> <ul> <li> <strong>Example:</strong> <ul> <li>Customer demographics (age, income, location)</li> <li>Market trends in interest rates, competitor offers, economic indicators</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>How it helps</strong>: Broad segmentation (e.g., higher income bracket might qualify for a premium card) and understanding general market conditions.</li> <li> <strong>Contextualize for Better Analysis:</strong> <ul> <li>Localized economic data alongside customer demographics could reveal underserved areas where the bank can expand its card offerings.</li> <li>Sudden changes in economic forecasts or competitor actions might trigger proactive offers to solidify relationships with existing customers.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>User Data</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Website behavior</strong>: Tracking user navigation paths to reveal buying intent or improve site design. Going beyond basic page views, contextualization could incorporate external economic data or user demographics to understand if browsing behavior is driven by necessity or changing financial priorities.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>App engagement</strong>: Analyzing in-app behavior to identify churn indicators or opportunities to boost retention. Contextualize for Better Analysis: Adding LLM-derived sentiment analysis of user support queries within the app adds a new dimension to understanding pain points. This can reveal issues beyond technical bugs, potentially highlighting misaligned features or confusing user experience elements.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>LLM engagement</strong>: Flowback LLM analytics data as <strong>in-house technical / business users and end-customers of your platform interact with other LLM applications. This could include insights on the types of queries, responses, and feedback generated within the LLM ecosystem</strong>. This is where ELT-C shines! LLM queries can be correlated with other user actions across systems. For instance, are users researching competitor offerings in the LLM, then browsing specific product pages on the bank’s site? This context highlights a customer considering alternatives and the need for urgent proactive engagement.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><br></p> <hr> <h1 id="context-bridge--stores">Context Bridge &amp; Stores</h1> <p><br></p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/contexts.png" alt="Conceptual Context Bridge"></p> <p>In image above, a Context Bridge that provides real time contexts across multiple publishers and subsribers.

By strategically incorporating the Contextualize (C) step at different points in the pipeline, we create several permutations. While in this post, We explored Contextualize(C) following an ETL step, the Context can be injected at any stage of the ETL process, and even multiple times.</p> <p>Understanding these variations - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ELT-C</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ELT-C</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EC-T</code>, and even <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EL-C-T-C</code> is key to designing a data pipeline that best aligns with your specific needs and data architecture. Let’s explore these permutations and their implications.</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>ETL-C</strong> (discussed in majority of this post above)</p> <ul> <li> <strong>ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)</strong>: This is the traditional approach where data is: <ul> <li>Extracted from source systems</li> <li>Transformed into a desired format and structure</li> <li>Loaded into a target data warehouse or lake</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>C (Contextualize)</strong>: After the data is cleaned and structured within the target system, an additional step enriches it by adding relevant context (metadata, external data, user interactions)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>ELT-C</strong></p> <ul> <li> <strong>EL (Extract, Load):</strong> Emphasizes loading raw data into the target system as quickly as possible. Transformations and cleaning are deferred.</li> <li> <strong>T (Transform):</strong> Once in the target system (typically suitable for big data), transformations are applied, often leveraging the target system’s processing power.</li> <li> <strong>C (Contextualize):</strong> Similar to ETL-C, context is added as a final enrichment step.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>EL-C-T</strong></p> <ul> <li> <strong>EL (Extract, Load):</strong> Same as in ELT-C, raw data is prioritized for quick ingestion.</li> <li> <strong>C (Contextualize):</strong> Contextualization occurs immediately after loading, adding context while the data is still raw. This might involve linking external data or incorporating real-time insights.</li> <li> <strong>T (Transform):</strong> Finally, the now contextually enriched data undergoes transformations for cleaning, formatting, and structuring.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>EL-C-T-C</strong></p> <ul> <li> <strong>EL (Extract, Load)</strong>: Identical initial step to the previous variations.</li> <li> <strong>C (Contextualize)</strong>: Context is added after loading, as explained before.</li> <li> <strong>T (Transform)</strong>: Transformations are applied.</li> <li> <strong>C (Contextualize)</strong>: An additional contextualization layer is added after transformations. This might involve re-evaluating context based on the transformed data or deriving new contextual features.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p><br></p> <h3 id="when-to-choose-which">When to Choose Which</h3> <p>The optimal permutation depends on factors like:</p> <ul> <li>Data Size and Velocity: If dealing with massive, rapidly changing data, ELT-C might prioritize rapid loading for analysis or model training.</li> <li>Need for Clean Data: Traditional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ETL-C</code> is still valuable when clean, structured data is a hard requirement for downstream systems.</li> <li>Dynamic Context: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EL-C-T</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EL-C-T-C</code> are valuable when context is derived from the raw data itself or needs to be updated alongside transformations.</li> </ul> <p>Do note that, these are not always strictly distinct. Modern data pipelines are often hybrid, employing elements of different patterns based on the specific data source or use case.</p> <p><br></p> <h3 id="a-el-c-t-c-scenario">A EL-C-T-C Scenario</h3> <p><strong>Scenario</strong>: Real-time Sentiment Analysis for Social Media</p> <p><strong>Challenge</strong>: Social media is a goldmine of raw customer sentiment, but extracting actionable insights quickly from its unstructured, ever-changing nature is complex.</p> <p><strong>How EL-C-T-C Helps</strong>:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Extract (E): A system continuously pulls raw social media data (posts, tweets, comments) from various platforms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Load (L): The raw data is loaded directly into a scalable data lake for immediate accessibility.</p> </li> <li> <p>Contextualize (C1): Initial contextualization is applied:</p> <ul> <li>Metadata: Timestamp, social platform, geo-location (if available)</li> <li>Basic Sentiment: Text analysis tools assign preliminary sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Transform (T):</p> <ul> <li>NLP: Natural Language Processing models extract key topics, product mentions, and finer-grained sentiment.</li> <li>Cleanup: Filters remove spam and irrelevant content.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Contextualize (C2): The transformed data is further enriched:</p> <ul> <li>Entity Linking: Identified brand and product mentions link to internal product Knowledge Graphs or external product databases.</li> <li>Trend Analysis: Data is cross-referenced with historical data for trend analysis. Are complaints about a particular feature increasing? Is positive sentiment surrounding a new competitor emerging?</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p><br></p> <h4 id="why-el-c-t-c-works-here">Why EL-C-T-C Works Here:</h4> <ul> <li>Speed: Raw data is ingested immediately, crucial for real-time analysis.</li> <li>Contextual Insights on Raw Data: Basic sentiment and metadata are added quickly, allowing for preliminary alerting on urgent issues.</li> <li>Evolving Context: The second contextualization layer refines sentiment, unlocks deeper insights (e.g., issues tied to specific features), and adds valuable trend context after transformations enhance the data.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Outcome</strong><br> The business has a dashboard that not only tracks the real-time sentiment surrounding their brand and products, but can drill down on the drivers of those sentiments. This data empowers them to proactively address customer concerns, protect brand reputation, and make data-informed product and marketing decisions.</p> <hr> <p>Is ELT-C the right choice for your data workflows? If you’re looking to fully unlock the potential of your data, I recommend giving this framework a closer look. Begin by identifying areas where integrating more context could substantially improve your analytics or machine learning models.</p> <p>I’m eager to hear your perspective!
