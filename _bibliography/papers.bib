  title={Automated Synthesis and Verification of Distributed Systems Using Universal Plan Intermediate Representation (UPIR)},
  author={Mitra, Subhadip},
  abstract={This work addresses the gap between distributed system specifications and their implementations through a novel framework combining formal verification, program synthesis, and machine learning. UPIR features a compositional verification engine achieving 274x speedup for 64-component systems using SMT solving with proof caching, a synthesis engine applying Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS), and a constrained reinforcement learning optimizer using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for parameter improvement while preserving formal guarantees. Benchmark tests demonstrate 60.1% latency reduction with 194.5% throughput increase, with 89.9% pattern reuse potential identified through clustering analysis.},

  title={Field-Theoretic Context System (FTCS)},
  author={Mitra, Subhadip},
  abstract={This disclosure describes an approach to context processing that models context as interacting fields rather than discrete states. A field-theoretic context system (FTCS) as described herein enables natural context flow, relationship preservation, and dynamic evolution through partial differential equations that govern field dynamics. The FTCS described herein represents an advancement in context processing by replacing discrete states with continuous, evolving fields. This approach more accurately reflects how information behaves in real-world systems. A key aspect is the non-conservative approach of the FTCS by which context can be genuinely created, amplified, diminished, or eliminated as information gains or loses relevance. This overcomes limitations of traditional context systems that rely on discrete states, manual mapping, and rigid hierarchies.},

  author={Mitra, Subhadip},
  abstract={As organizations adopt generative AI, data pipelines often lack the dynamic context needed. This paper introduces ETLC (Extract, Transform, Load, Contextualize), adding semantic, relational, operational, environmental, and behavioral context. ETLC enables Dynamic Context Engines for context-aware RAG, AI co-pilots, and agentic systems. It works with standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for effective context delivery, ensuring business-specific AI outputs.},

  title={Adaptive Reasoning and Evaluation Framework for Multi-agent Intelligent Systems in Debate-driven Decision-making},
  author={Mitra, Subhadip},
  abstract={Collective decisions require debate to surface contrastive points of view and to enable balanced and well-informed decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) can provide an opportunity to formulate deliberative decision making through multiple artificial intelligence (AI) agents. However, existing LLMs struggle with complex group discussions. This disclosure describes an artificial intelligence framework and techniques to support complex debate scenarios and group decision-making. A tiered structure of language models is deployed to dynamically generate and evaluate arguments. The techniques can handle multi-participant debates while considering ethical implications, producing well-reasoned outcomes. The described framework addresses limitations in existing debate systems by offering improved scalability, structured argumentation, and dynamic evaluation criteria. Example applications include policymaking, scientific discourse, corporate strategy, etc., and generally, any situation where thorough analysis and informed decision-making are crucial.},

  author={Mitra, Subhadip},
  abstract={In the current connected world - Websites, Mobile Apps, IoT Devices collect a large volume of users' personally identifiable activity data. These collected data is used for varied purposes of analytics, marketing, personalization of services, etc. Data is assimilated through site cookies, tracking device IDs, embedded JavaScript, Pixels, etc. to name a few. Many of these tracking and usage of collected data happens behind the scenes and is not apparent to an average user. Consequently, many Countries and Regions have formulated legislations (e.g., GDPR, EU) - that allow users to be able to control their personal data, be informed and consent to its processing in a comprehensible and user-friendly manner.This paper proposes a protocol and a platform based on Blockchain Technology that enables the transparent processing of personal data throughout its lifecycle from capture, lineage to redaction. The solution intends to help service multiple stakeholders from individual end-users to Data Controllers and Privacy Officers. It intends to offer a holistic and unambiguous view of how and when the data points are captured, accessed, and processed. The framework also envisages how different access control policies might be created and enforced through a public blockchain including real time alerts for privacy data breach.},

  title={Cascading Algorithm: Bayesian Price Convergence for Arbitrage-Free Option Pricing},
  author={Mitra, Subhadip},
  abstract={In this paper, I introduce a novel Cascading Algorithm that leverages Bayesian inference to facilitate arbitrage-free pricing of financial options. Our approach uniquely integrates prior market knowledge with sequentially updated price information to create a convergent pricing model that continuously refines the estimates of option prices under the principle of no-arbitrage. By employing Bayesian updating mechanisms, the algorithm accounts for uncertainties inherent in market data and dynamically adjusts to new information, ensuring robust convergence towards equilibrium prices. We detail the mathematical framework that underpins our model, emphasizing the convergence properties of the algorithm through both theoretical analysis and extensive simulation. The Cascading Algorithm is tested against standard datasets, demonstrating superior performance in achieving faster convergence and higher accuracy in price estimates compared to traditional models. This work not only provides a significant advancement in option pricing but also proposes a framework that could be extended to other financial instruments for achieving efficient, arbitrage-free market predictions.},

  title={Low Energy Wireless Electricity Transmission Using Resonant Magnetic Coupling},
  author={Mitra, Subhadip},
  abstract={This paper explores the innovative realm of low-energy wireless electricity transmission, presenting a novel framework for transmitting electrical power without direct physical connections and minimizing energy loss. I start by examining the current methodologies and limitations of traditional wireless power transfer systems, including inductive, capacitive, and radiative techniques. The focus then shifts to the development of a new, more efficient transmission method that leverages advancements in electromagnetic and resonance technologies to enhance range and energy efficiency. Through a series of experiments and simulations, I demonstrate how our proposed system reduces energy wastage and improves the viability of wireless power for a broader range of applications, from small consumer electronics to large-scale industrial machinery. The findings suggest significant implications for the future of energy distribution, potentially leading to safer, cleaner, and more flexible power management systems. The paper concludes with a discussion on the potential environmental impacts and the economic benefits of adopting low-energy wireless electricity transmission technologies.},
