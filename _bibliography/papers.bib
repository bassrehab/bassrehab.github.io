  title={Adaptive Reasoning and Evaluation Framework for Multi-agent Intelligent Systems in Debate-driven Decision-making},
  author={Mitra, Subhadip},
  abstract={Collective decisions require debate to surface contrastive points of view and to enable balanced and well-informed decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) can provide an opportunity to formulate deliberative decision making through multiple artificial intelligence (AI) agents. However, existing LLMs struggle with complex group discussions. This disclosure describes an artificial intelligence framework and techniques to support complex debate scenarios and group decision-making. A tiered structure of language models is deployed to dynamically generate and evaluate arguments. The techniques can handle multi-participant debates while considering ethical implications, producing well-reasoned outcomes. The described framework addresses limitations in existing debate systems by offering improved scalability, structured argumentation, and dynamic evaluation criteria. Example applications include policymaking, scientific discourse, corporate strategy, etc., and generally, any situation where thorough analysis and informed decision-making are crucial.},

  title={Data Monetization Strategy for Enterprises},
  author={Mitra, Subhadip},
  abstract={This paper presents an in-depth exploration of Data Monetization for Enterprises that would enable them to effectively transform their data assets into significant economic value. The paper introduces: (a) Data Monetization Framework - that encompasses key strategic technical capabilities, collaborative Data Product development, agile experimentation, product incubation, delivery model, pricing model and privacy/security by design; and (b) Activation of the Data Monetization Strategy - a 12-month long structured approach is discussed to implement, operationalize, scale, and sustain the strategy-through a Data COE. Data Product Development, Pricing Strategy, Delivery Mode and prioritization is also discussed through a Value-effort study. Technology strategy is discussed in detail with MoSCoW scoring. The paper delves into the role of emerging technologies such as generative AI (large language models), big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning in enhancing data monetization efforts. It also addresses the challenges and opportunities presented by these technologies, including issues related to data privacy, security, and ethical considerations.},

  title={OConsent: Open Consent Protocol for Privacy and Consent Management with Blockchain},
  author={Mitra, Subhadip},
  abstract={In the current connected world - Websites, Mobile Apps, IoT Devices collect a large volume of users' personally identifiable activity data. These collected data is used for varied purposes of analytics, marketing, personalization of services, etc. Data is assimilated through site cookies, tracking device IDs, embedded JavaScript, Pixels, etc. to name a few. Many of these tracking and usage of collected data happens behind the scenes and is not apparent to an average user. Consequently, many Countries and Regions have formulated legislations (e.g., GDPR, EU) - that allow users to be able to control their personal data, be informed and consent to its processing in a comprehensible and user-friendly manner.This paper proposes a protocol and a platform based on Blockchain Technology that enables the transparent processing of personal data throughout its lifecycle from capture, lineage to redaction. The solution intends to help service multiple stakeholders from individual end-users to Data Controllers and Privacy Officers. It intends to offer a holistic and unambiguous view of how and when the data points are captured, accessed, and processed. The framework also envisages how different access control policies might be created and enforced through a public blockchain including real time alerts for privacy data breach.},

  title={Cascading algorithm: Bayesian price convergence for arbitrage free option pricing},
  author={Mitra, Subhadip},
  abstract={In this paper, I introduce a novel Cascading Algorithm that leverages Bayesian inference to facilitate arbitrage-free pricing of financial options. Our approach uniquely integrates prior market knowledge with sequentially updated price information to create a convergent pricing model that continuously refines the estimates of option prices under the principle of no-arbitrage. By employing Bayesian updating mechanisms, the algorithm accounts for uncertainties inherent in market data and dynamically adjusts to new information, ensuring robust convergence towards equilibrium prices. We detail the mathematical framework that underpins our model, emphasizing the convergence properties of the algorithm through both theoretical analysis and extensive simulation. The Cascading Algorithm is tested against standard datasets, demonstrating superior performance in achieving faster convergence and higher accuracy in price estimates compared to traditional models. This work not only provides a significant advancement in option pricing but also proposes a framework that could be extended to other financial instruments for achieving efficient, arbitrage-free market predictions.},

  title={Low energy wireless electricity transmission},
  author={Mitra, Subhadip},
  abstract={This paper explores the innovative realm of low-energy wireless electricity transmission, presenting a novel framework for transmitting electrical power without direct physical connections and minimizing energy loss. I start by examining the current methodologies and limitations of traditional wireless power transfer systems, including inductive, capacitive, and radiative techniques. The focus then shifts to the development of a new, more efficient transmission method that leverages advancements in electromagnetic and resonance technologies to enhance range and energy efficiency. Through a series of experiments and simulations, I demonstrate how our proposed system reduces energy wastage and improves the viability of wireless power for a broader range of applications, from small consumer electronics to large-scale industrial machinery. The findings suggest significant implications for the future of energy distribution, potentially leading to safer, cleaner, and more flexible power management systems. The paper concludes with a discussion on the potential environmental impacts and the economic benefits of adopting low-energy wireless electricity transmission technologies.},
