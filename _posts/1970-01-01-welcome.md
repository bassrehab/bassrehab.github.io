**Welcome to my blog!**

Think of this blog as my tech sandbox. Sometimes you'll see polished sandcastles, other times just random scribbles. I wanted a place to build things that's a bit more open than my usual social media spots. We'll explore the people behind the tech, plus plenty of coding adventures. This is my space, but guest builders are welcome!

Let's keep the conversation flowing! Share and discuss my posts wherever you like online. [#binarybreakthroughs](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23binarybreakthroughs)

Ideas sparking? Want to team up on a project? [Hit me up](mailto:contact@subhadipmitra.com)!

Let's get building!
