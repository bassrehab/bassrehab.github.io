I have been working as an architect and a software engineer for over 12 years, engaging with clients around the world (ranging from Big Techs, Fortune 500s to contending startups), helping them challenge the status-quo and realizing their Data, AI and Cloud technology led business transformations.

When I am not working you would find me either stargazing, drifting cars, conceptualizing the next startup, [9gag-ing](https://9gag.com/), binge watching [Family Guy](https://youtu.be/isS5K9nOhd8) or out on late night walks with Astro. I am an entrepreneur at heart, and it all started with [truckaurbus.com](https://truckaurbus.com). I love everything open source.
