At **Google Cloud**, I lead Data Analytics and serve as Site Lead for Southeast Asia, driving large-scale transformations that directly impact business outcomes:

- Leading $20M+ in mission-critical enterprise projects with consistent delivery excellence
- Architecting scalable, resilient data platforms handling petabyte-scale workloads
- Building high-performing engineering teams across APAC with 100% client satisfaction

While directing strategic initiatives, I maintain deep technical involvement through innovative frameworks:

- **Multi-Agent Decision Framework** — Invented an adaptive system for enterprise decision-making, ([ARTEMIS](https://www.tdcommons.org/dpubs_series/7729/))
- **Next-Gen Data Platform Architecture** — Framework reimagining data integration for the Generative AI era, ([ETLC](https://subhadipmitra.com/blog/2024/etlc-adaptive-contexts-and-contextual-joins/)) 
- **Privacy & Consent Protocols** — open frameworks for secure data sharing and transparent consent management


I've also developed proprietary approaches for continuous context propagation (patent-pending) and automated cloud workload discovery using billion-node graph models for architecture optimization.

#### Engineering Leadership Across Enterprise & Startup Environments

My journey as founder of a B2B digital [marketplace](https://truckaurbus.com) (scaled across 15 cities) informs my approach to enterprise transformation—combining startup agility with enterprise-grade scalability.

At Standard Chartered Bank, I led the development of enterprise-wide AI platforms serving 11 markets while reducing ML deployment cycles from 6 months to 1 week. I applied this same focus on measurable impact at Google Cloud, driving technical architecture that delivers 20-60% performance improvements in high-volume data systems.
