At **Google Cloud**, I lead Data Analytics and serve as Site Lead for Southeast Asia, where I manage multi-million-dollar initiatives and mentor high-performing teams—all while remaining an active engineer and researcher. My background also includes founding a B2B digital [marketplace](https://truckaurbus.com), which has enriched my approach by blending startup agility with enterprise-grade strategy.


#### Core Expertise

- **Leadership & Strategy:** Shaping technology vision and guiding cross-functional teams.
- **Hands-On Engineering:** Developing innovative AI, Data, and Cloud solutions.
- **Digital Transformation:** Architecting scalable platforms that deliver measurable business impact.
- **Entrepreneurial Insight:** Merging startup innovation with proven enterprise methodologies.

#### Innovations & Research

- **Multi-Agent Decision Framework** — Invented an adaptive system for enterprise decision-making, ([ARTEMIS](https://www.tdcommons.org/dpubs_series/7729/), 2025)
- **Next-Gen Data Platform Architecture** — Framework reimagining data integration for the Generative AI era, ([ETLC](https://subhadipmitra.com/blog/2024/etlc-adaptive-contexts-and-contextual-joins/), 2024) 
- **Privacy & Consent Protocols** — open frameworks ([OLP](https://olp-protocol.com), 2022; [OConsent](https://oconsent.io), 2021) for secure data sharing and transparent consent management.
- **Proprietary Methods:** Invented techniques for continuous context propagation and scalable workload discovery using billion-node graph models.


#### Current Research Focus

My technical explorations currently center on two emerging frontiers:
- **Multi-agent systems for enterprise decision-making** — Architecting autonomous systems that reason, debate, and solve complex business problems
- **Privacy-preserving AI architectures** — Developing frameworks that enable advanced analytics while maintaining robust data governance
