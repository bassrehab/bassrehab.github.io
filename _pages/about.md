Welcome to my binary odysseys! I'm Subhadip Mitra, your guide through the exhilarating world of Data, AI, and Cloud technologies. For the past 15+ years, I've been coding, architecting, and leading transformative projects for industry titans and innovative startups alike.

Currently, I'm leading the Data & Analytics practice for Southeast Asia at Google. My work spans from designing advanced Data & AI platforms to spearheading multimillion-dollar project portfolios across Southeast Asia, while also crafting and executing go-to-market strategies for our Data Practice. This dynamic role combines technical innovation, strategic leadership, and delivery excellence to drive transformative outcomes for major enterprises in the region.

Off the clock, I'm a [constellation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkQuOrsgVGY) chaser, [asphalt surfer](https://youtu.be/hepFlpCdTgU?si=hCVeZfF1x5xmOKUe&t=82), startup dreamweaver, and meme connoisseur. You might find me laughing uproariously at [Family Guy](https://youtu.be/y1CotE1_Q4M?si=-PbJel0rtajfQPAW&t=68), lost in the endless scroll of [9gag](https://9gag.com/), or meandering through the midnight cityscape with my trusty canine companion, [Astro](/assets/img/astro.jpg). My entrepreneurial tech tale began with a humble website, [truckaurbus.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20170722135749/http://www.truckaurbus.com/new-cv.html), and evolved into a passion for open-source projects.

## what I do

**Software / Data Engineering:**
I design and build internet-scale, service-oriented, distributed applications, specializing in low-latency real-time data processing and ML engineering. My toolkit includes Java, Python, and Node.js, with proficiency in technologies like Apache Spark, Kafka, Hadoop, Hive, and BigQuery. I architect robust data pipelines and platforms, handling petabytes of data, building global Data Lakes, and engineering real-time in-memory platforms processing millions of events per second.
<br />

**Machine Learning & AI:**
From developing fraud detection systems to creating self-service ML workbenches, I bring ML models from concept to production. I'm deeply involved in Generative AI, fine-tuning Large Language Models, and implementing advanced techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). My expertise extends to Multi-Agent Systems and ML Infrastructure, enabling scalable and efficient AI solutions.
<br />

**Cloud Architecture:**
As a Google Cloud Certified Professional in multiple domains, I design and implement multi-cloud solutions, lead cloud migrations, and optimize cloud-native architectures for performance and cost-efficiency.
<br />

**Technology Consulting:**
Leveraging my hands-on experience and strategic insight, I assist organizations in innovating, managing risks, reducing costs, and securing competitive strategic differentiation. I provide C-level advisory services grounded in practical, implementable solutions.
<br />

**Research Interests:**  
I'm perpetually curious, exploring - Algorithms, Distributed Systems, and Parallel Computing. My fascination extends to Machine Intelligence, the enigmatic realms of Large Language Models, and the pioneering frontiers of Quantum Computing.
<br />
<br />

**Embark on this adventure with me as I unveil the arcane, explore the unknown, and share tales from the tech frontier. Expect a blend of insight, imagination, and a dash of whimsyâ€”right here, where technology meets creativity.**
