At **Google Cloud**, I lead Data Analytics and serve as Site Lead for Southeast Asia, where I manage multi-million-dollar initiatives and mentor high-performing teams-all while remaining an active engineer and researcher. My background also includes founding a B2B digital [marketplace](https://truckaurbus.com), which has enriched my approach by blending startup agility with enterprise-grade strategy.

#### What I Do

**Strategic Leadership** - Driving digital transformation and cloud adoption across enterprise organizations in Southeast Asia.

**Research & Innovation** - Developing novel approaches to AI systems, from field-theoretic context models to multi-agent frameworks. Published in technical disclosures and industry whitepapers.

**Hands-On Engineering** - Building production systems, contributing to open-source frameworks, and maintaining active codebases.

**Entrepreneurial Experience** - Founded and scaled a B2B marketplace, bringing startup agility to enterprise strategy.

#### Select Innovations & Frameworks

- **Field-Theoretic Context System (FTCS)** - Pioneered a novel approach to context processing that models context as interacting fields rather than discrete states, enabling natural context flow and dynamic evolution. ([Technical Disclosure](https://www.tdcommons.org/dpubs_series/8022/), 2025)

- **ETLC: Context-First Data Processing** - Developed a framework that reimagines data integration for the Generative AI era by adding semantic, relational, operational, environmental, and behavioral context. ([Google Cloud Whitepaper](https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/etlc_full_paper.pdf), 2025)

- **Multi-Agent Decision Framework (ARTEMIS)** - Invented an adaptive system for enterprise decision-making, ([Technical Disclosure](https://www.tdcommons.org/dpubs_series/7729/), 2025)

- **AI Metacognition Toolkit** - Open-source framework for systematic reasoning in AI systems  [Documentation](https://ai-metacognition-toolkit.subhadipmitra.com/) • [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ai-metacognition-toolkit/) • [GitHub](https://github.com/bassrehab/ai-metacognition-toolkit)

- **Privacy & Consent Protocols** - open frameworks ([OLP](https://olpprotocol.com), 2022; [OConsent](https://oconsent.io), 2021) for secure data sharing and transparent consent management.

<br />


#### Current Research Focus

- **Contextual AI Systems** - Field-theoretic approaches to context representation, efficient relationship modeling, and dynamic information flow.

- **Multi-Agent Enterprises** - Practical [frameworks](https://github.com/bassrehab/pycontext) for coordinated AI agents solving complex business problems at scale.

- **LLM Infrastructure** - Efficient deployment architectures, inference acceleration, and cost-effective serving strategies.

- **Spatiotemporal Analytics** - Graph-theoretic models for cloud infrastructure optimization and resource scheduling.
