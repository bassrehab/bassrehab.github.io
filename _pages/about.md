Welcome to the Chronicles of Code! I’m your resident architect and software engineer, navigating through the labyrinth of Data, AI, and Cloud technologies. For the past fourteen years, I've partnered with titans and trailblazers alike, weaving magic into the fabric of their businesses and tech landscape.

Off the clock, I'm a constellation chaser, [asphalt surfer](https://youtu.be/hepFlpCdTgU?si=hCVeZfF1x5xmOKUe&t=82), startup dreamweaver, and meme connoisseur. You might find me laughing uproariously at [Family Guy](https://youtu.be/y1CotE1_Q4M?si=-PbJel0rtajfQPAW&t=68), lost in the endless scroll of [9gag](https://9gag.com/), or meandering through the midnight cityscape with my trusty canine companion, [Astro](assets/img/astro.jpg). My tech tale began with a humble website, truckaurbus.com, and grew into a passionate crusade for the open-source realm.

<br />

## what I do

**Software Engineering:**  
I craft digital dreams and engineer realities - that are internet scale, service-oriented, distributed applications specializing in low latency RT data processing and ML engineering.
<br />

**Technology Consulting:**  
Leveraging my experience in sectors like banking, telecom, technology and public services, I assist organizations in innovating, managing risks, reducing costs, and securing competitive edges.
<br />

**Research Interests:**  
I'm perpetually curious, exploring - Algorithms, Distributed Systems, and Parallel Computing. My fascination extends to Machine Intelligence, the enigmatic realms of Large Language Models, and the pioneering frontiers of Quantum Computing.
<br />
<br />

Embark on this adventure with me as I unveil the arcane, explore the unknown, and share tales from the tech frontier. Expect a blend of insight, imagination, and a dash of whimsy—right here, where technology meets creativity.
