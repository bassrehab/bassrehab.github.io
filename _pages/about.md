A hands-on technology leader, I leverage Data, AI, and Cloud to drive transformative change and deliver significant business value. Leading Google Cloud's Data & Analytics practice in Southeast Asia, I build and mentor high-performing teams, deliver enterprise-grade solutions, guide digital strategy, and remain deeply involved in the technical details. I'm driven to build the next generation of innovative products and services, particularly at the intersection of Generative AI and Large-Scale Data Platforms.


### my expertise

- **Strategic Leadership & Vision**: I excel at developing and executing data-driven strategies that align with overall business objectives. I've partnered with C-suite executives across Southeast Asia to guide their digital transformation journeys, providing strategic consulting that leverages emerging technologies, manages risk, and delivers significant and measurable business impact, including the successful delivery of projects with a combined portfolio value of over $30+ million. My frameworks for Data/AI strategy and cloud adoption have been adopted across JAPAC.
- **Building & Leading High-Performing Teams**:  I have a passion for building, mentoring, and leading diverse, high-performing engineering teams. I foster a culture of innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning.
- **Hands-On Technical Expertise & Innovation**: I have deep expertise in architecting and delivering complex, petabyte-scale Data & AI platforms. I'm at the forefront of innovation, contributing to internal Google projects in areas of multi-agent decision-making and context modeling. I've developed the **ETLC** framework for GenAI-era data platforms and designed a solution for optimizing data architectures at the billion-node scale.  I'm also the creator of the [OConsent](https://oconsent.io/) and [Open Location Proof](https://olp-protocol.org/) protocols. My commitment to pushing technical boundaries is demonstrated through active coding contributions and leading deep technical investigations, particularly in the realm of Generative AI and Large-Scale Data Platforms.
- **Thought Leadership & Future Focus:** I'm a recognized thought leader in Data, AI, and Cloud, actively contributing to industry publications and forums. My current research interests include exploring new frontiers in data processing, pipeline optimization, and stream architectures to unlock unprecedented efficiency and real-time insights.

At **Google Cloud**, I lead Data Analytics and serve as Site Lead for Southeast Asia, driving large-scale transformations that directly impact business outcomes:

- Leading $20M+ in mission-critical enterprise projects with consistent delivery excellence
- Architecting scalable, resilient data platforms handling petabyte-scale workloads
- Building high-performing engineering teams across APAC with 100% client satisfaction

While directing strategic initiatives, I maintain deep technical involvement through innovative frameworks:

- **Multi-Agent Decision Framework** — Invented an adaptive system for enterprise decision-making, ([ARTEMIS](https://www.tdcommons.org/dpubs_series/7729/))
- **Next-Gen Data Platform Architecture** — Framework reimagining data integration for the Generative AI era, ([ETLC](https://subhadipmitra.com/blog/2024/etlc-adaptive-contexts-and-contextual-joins/)) 
- **Privacy & Consent Protocols** — open frameworks for secure data sharing and transparent consent management


I've also developed proprietary approaches for continuous context propagation (patent-pending) and automated cloud workload discovery using billion-node graph models for architecture optimization.

#### Engineering Leadership Across Enterprise & Startup Environments

My journey as founder of a B2B digital [marketplace](https://truckaurbus.com) (scaled across 15 cities) informs my approach to enterprise transformation—combining startup agility with enterprise-grade scalability.

At Standard Chartered Bank, I led the development of enterprise-wide AI platforms serving 11 markets while reducing ML deployment cycles from 6 months to 1 week. I applied this same focus on measurable impact at Google Cloud, driving technical architecture that delivers 20-60% performance improvements in high-volume data systems.
