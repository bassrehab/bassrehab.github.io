At **Google Cloud**, I lead Data Analytics and serve as Site Lead for Southeast Asia, driving large-scale transformations that directly impact business outcomes:

- Leading $20M+ in mission-critical enterprise projects with consistent delivery excellence
- Architecting scalable, resilient data platforms handling petabyte-scale workloads
- Building high-performing engineering teams across APAC with 100% client satisfaction

<<<<<<< HEAD
While directing strategic initiatives, I maintain deep technical involvement through innovative frameworks:
=======
#### Notable Outcomes
- **$20M+ Delivery Portfolio:** Managing 50+ enterprise-scale projects with 100% customer satisfaction and proactive escalation management.
- **$30M+ Business Impact:** Leading cloud transformation initiatives that fuel robust revenue growth across JAPAC.
- **Innovative Frameworks:**  
  - Published [ARTEMIS](https://www.tdcommons.org/dpubs_series/7729/) – an adaptive multi-agent debate framework transforming real-time decision-making.
  - Invented proprietary approaches for continuous context propagation and scalable workload discovery.
  - Created the [ETLC](https://subhadipmitra.com/blog/2024/etlc-adaptive-contexts-and-contextual-joins/) framework, reimagining data platforms for the Generative AI era.
  - Engineered privacy-centric protocols ([Open Location Proof](https://olp-protocol.org) & [Open Consent Protocol](https://oconsent.io)) for secure data sharing and transparent consent management.
- **High-Performing Teams:** Built and mentored top-tier engineering groups across Southeast Asia, fostering a culture of ownership, innovation, and rapid delivery.

I've also developed proprietary approaches for continuous context propagation (patent-pending) and automated cloud workload discovery using billion-node graph models for architecture optimization.

#### Engineering Leadership Across Enterprise & Startup Environments

My journey as founder of a B2B digital [marketplace](https://truckaurbus.com) (scaled across 15 cities) informs my approach to enterprise transformation—combining startup agility with enterprise-grade scalability.

At Standard Chartered Bank, I led the development of enterprise-wide AI platforms serving 11 markets while reducing ML deployment cycles from 6 months to 1 week. I applied this same focus on measurable impact at Google Cloud, driving technical architecture that delivers 20-60% performance improvements in high-volume data systems.

#### Technical Publications & Innovation

- [Engineering Autonomous Multi-Agent Systems](https://subhadipmitra.com/blog/2025/telecom-autonomous-multi-agent-genai-system/) — Technical architecture for large-scale AI systems (Jan 2025)
- [Context-Aware Data Pipelines](https://subhadipmitra.com/blog/2024/etlc-adaptive-contexts-and-contextual-joins/) — Framework for next-generation data integration at scale (Dec 2024)
- [Privacy-Centric Consent Framework](https://oconsent.io/) — an open protocol for transparent data management (2021)
- [Secure Location Data Architecture](https://olp-protocol.org/) — Framework for verifiable location sharing (2021)



#### Current Research Focus

My technical explorations currently center on two emerging frontiers:
- **Multi-agent systems for enterprise decision-making** — Architecting autonomous systems that reason, debate, and solve complex business problems
- **Privacy-preserving AI architectures** — Developing frameworks that enable advanced analytics while maintaining robust data governance
