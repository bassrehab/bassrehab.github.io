Welcome to my binary odysseys! I'm Subhadip, a seasoned technologist with 15+ years of experience wrangling data, crafting AI magic, and navigating the cloud. Currently, I lead Google's Data & Analytics practice in Southeast Asia, where we build cutting-edge solutions for the region's biggest players.

### what I do

- **Software & Data Engineering:** I engineer internet-scale applications, data pipelines, and platforms that handle petabytes of data and millions of events per second. My toolkit includes Java, Python, Spark, Kafka, and more.
- **Machine Learning & AI:** I bring ML models to life, from fraud detection systems to generative AI applications. I'm passionate about Large Language Models, RAG, RLHF, and Multi-Agent Systems.
- **Cloud Architecture:** I design and implement multi-cloud solutions that are optimized for performance and cost.
- **Technology Consulting:** I provide C-level advisory services, helping organizations leverage technology to drive innovation, manage risk, and achieve strategic goals.
- **Research Interests:** I'm perpetually curious, exploring - Algorithms, Distributed Systems, and Parallel Computing. My fascination extends to Machine Intelligence, the enigmatic realms of Large Language Models, and the pioneering frontiers of Quantum Computing.

### beyond the code

When I'm not immersed in the digital world, you'll find me [stargazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkQuOrsgVGY), [drifting](https://youtu.be/hepFlpCdTgU?si=hCVeZfF1x5xmOKUe&t=82) or conjuring up the next startup idea. You might find me laughing uproariously at [Family Guy](https://youtu.be/y1CotE1_Q4M?si=-PbJel0rtajfQPAW&t=68), lost in the endless scroll of [9gag](https://9gag.com/), or meandering through the midnight cityscape with my furry friend, [Astro](/assets/img/astro.jpg)
